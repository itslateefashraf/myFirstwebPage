                <p>Another eliminator and another loss for LSG. Interestingly, both losses have come while chasing in excess of 180-plus scores. Wasn't too long ago, Hardik said that he would hope to see his brother in Ahmedabad but instead it will be his former team he will be facing up against in the second qualifier. It's now down to three teams. Who will meet CSK on Sunday? We'll have to wait till Friday to trace the answer. Do remember to join us for that high-voltage clash. Remember, MI are the only team (from the playoff set) to beat Gujarat Titans in the league stage.

                        <b>Akash Madhwal | Player of the Match:</b>
                        I have been practicing a lot and waiting for my opportunity. I have done engineering, cricket is my passion and I have been waiting for this since 2018. When we practice in the nets, the management gives us the target and we try to execute our best. Hoping to do well in the coming games and want to end up as champions. The wicket of Nicholas Pooran was most pleasing for me.
                    </p>
                    <b>Rohit Sharma | MI Skipper:</b>
                    <p> That is what we have done over the years. People don't expect us to do what we have done, but we managed to. He (Akash) was the part of the team last year as a support bowler, and once Jofra was gone and I knew he had skills and the character to do the job for us. Over the years we have seen many guys coming in from Mumbai Indians and playing for India. It is important to make them (youngsters) feel special and make them feel part of the team, my job is to just make them comfortable in the middle. They are very clear in their roles about what they need to do for the team and that's what you want. As a team we enjoyed it (fielding). Good to see everyone contributing on the field. Coming to Chennai, we knew whole team needs to come to the party. At Wankhede you need one or two brilliant performances, but here it is a different ball game.
                    </p>
                
                        <b>Cameron Green: </b>
                        <p> Pretty good. It is the most complete game we have had. We are peaking at the right time. It is all clicking at the moment. Madhwal is bowling well, 5-fer today and a 4-fer in the last game. We had a pretty poor game (in the field) last time and we sat down and spoke about hunting in a pack. Obviously while bowling second all the guys are out there and we needed to bring that energy in the field. He (Madhwal) has been awesome ever since he has come into the team. They (Gujarat Titans) are the best team in the competition, slipped up a bit last night, but are still the best team and it will be a good game.</p>
                            <b>Krunal Pandya | LSG Skipper:</b>
                        
                            <p> We were in a good position at one stage, but everything started (going wrong) when I played that shot, we should have played better cricket. That shot (his wicket) was not on, I completely take the blame for that. The ball was coming nicely on to the bat, we just had to bat better. We didn't play good cricket after that strategic break. Quinton de Kock is a quality batter, but Mayers has a better record here, so we went ahead (in the playing XI) with him. Their batters bat really well against fast bowlers, so I thought of starting with spin against them.

                            <br>
                            Chasing 182, just one batter crossed 20 for the Lucknow Super Giants. A five-for. Three run-outs. Losing last 8 wickets for 32 runs. In the last 4 games (including this one) LSG had 4 different opening combinations. And here comes the best part: The openers from their last game weren't even part of the impact subs today. And the one who opened the batting last time LSG beat MI (just over a week ago) batted at 7 today. Gee, if those aforementioned facts/stats don't make up for a perfect disaster recipe, not sure what else would. To be fair, LSG conceded at least 20-30 extra and despite Stoinis' brilliance, a first-baller for Nic Pooran and the triple run-out harakiri just ended the disaster that was waiting to explode. As for Mumbai Indians, they will be chuffed to bits and will head into the qualifer with supreme confidence. Post-match reactions coming right up, stay tuned...
